PCM5102A Headphone Connection Issue:
====================================

Problem: Speakers on headphone pin but no audio

Possible Issues:
1. Headphone pin NOT connected to VOUTL+ and VOUTR+
2. Missing DC blocking capacitors (needed for headphone jack)
3. Headphone circuit not routed to PCM5102A outputs

PCM5102A Output Pins:
- VOUTL+ (Left channel output)
- VOUTR+ (Right channel output)
- VOUTL-/VOUTR- or GND (output ground)

Solutions:
1. Connect headphones DIRECTLY to:
   VOUTL+ -> Left headphone wire
   VOUTR+ -> Right headphone wire
   GND -> Common ground

2. Or check if headphone jack needs:
   - DC blocking capacitors (4.7uF or 10uF) in series
   - Volume control resistors (optional)

3. Test direct connection:
   Connect speaker/headphone wires directly to 
   VOUTL+ and VOUTR+ pins on PCM5102A chip

Quick Test:
- Touch wire from VOUTL+ to headphone + 
- Should hear audio (even if faint)
