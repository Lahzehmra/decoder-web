PCM5102A BCLK Issue:
====================

Current Situation:
- BCLK (SCK) is NOT connected
- Bypass jumper is OPEN (not closed)
- PCM5102A needs BCLK OR bypass jumper closed

Solution Options:
1. Connect BCLK: GPIO 18 (Pin 12) -> BCLK on PCM5102A
2. OR close the bypass jumper on the board

The bypass jumper allows PCM5102A to use internal clock
generation instead of external BCLK.

If jumper is open, BCLK MUST be connected.
