PCM5102A Pin Connections to Raspberry Pi:
=========================================
BCLK  -> GPIO 18 (Pin 12)
LRCLK -> GPIO 19 (Pin 35)  
DIN   -> GPIO 21 (Pin 40) [YOU CORRECTED THIS]
MCLK  -> GPIO 20 (Pin 38) - if needed
VCC   -> 3.3V (Pin 1)
GND   -> Ground (Pin 6)

PCM5102A Output:
LRCK (Volume) -> Speaker/Headphone
VOUTL+ -> Left channel output
VOUTR+ -> Right channel output
VOUTL- -> Ground
VOUTR- -> Ground

Check:
1. Are BCLK, LRCLK, DIN connected correctly?
2. Is PCM5102A power LED on?
3. Are speakers/headphones connected to VOUTL+ and VOUTR+?
4. Is MCLK connected? (PCM5102A needs MCLK = 256 * sample rate)
